                <p>I found that the reading “Overview of Data Visualization” by Qi Li provided a well explained understanding of data visualisation along with its history, significance and different forms. Through the analysis of the authors definition of data visualisation, data visualation’s evolution, the difference between data and information and the different forms of data visualisation, I intend to reflect on my own understanding of data visualisation and its importance in my studies. <br> <br>

                    Qi Li presents an in depth overview of data visualisation defining data visualisation as the transformation of quantified data into a visual or sonic representation, exploiting our visual perception abilities in order to amplify cognition (Li, 2020). The distinction between data and information is also thoroughly explained in the essay. Information is defined as processed data that has meaning and can be comprehended by humans, whereas data is defined as unprocessed information (Li, 2020). The process of data visualisation revolves around the conversion of data into information. The reading also discusses common data visualisation methods including trees, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams, and graphs. Each of these visual representations provides a unique impression that may be used to identify defects or issues. I believe that Qi Li is correct in stating that data visualisation is a useful tool for condensing and simplifying complex data in order to be utilised in the decision-making process (Li, 2020). We can spot patterns and correlations that might be hard to spot from raw data alone when the information is represented visually. In my own research, I found that “The Billion Dollar Gram” on the website “Information is Beautiful'' is an excellent example of data visualisation (McCandless, 2009). Through the use of vivid colours, interactive elements, and clear visual hierarchies, the website is able to make in depth and intricate information accessible to a wide audience showcasing how data visualisation can transform complex data into easily understandable and compelling visual narratives. <br> <br>
                    
                    Data visualisation, according to Qi Li, is critical in our perception and interpretation of data, especially in our present digital age when data processing must be as efficient as possible. It not only simplifies complex data but also aids in identifying patterns and correlations, which therefore facilitate decision-making processes. My understanding of data visualisation and its practical applications has been expanded after taking in this reading , which will be very useful in my studies in interactive media and game design where I will work closely with communicating data to users in an easy to understand manner. I believe it is just as important for those of us who design web pages, as web developers can use it to create more interactive and visually appealing websites that engage users and this allows for seamless navigation and interaction with the website, ensuring that the website effectively conveys information to users. I feel like I learned from my reading the importance of effectively visualising data to convey complex information to others in an understandable way. <br> <br>
                    
                    The reading “Overview of Data Visualization” by Qi Li has given me valuable insight into the field of data visualisation, its history and its significance of which I was only acutely aware of before. From this reading I have learnt that data visualisation plays an essential role in understanding and interpreting data with the “The Billion Dollar Gram" website serving as a good example of effective data visualisation. I look forward to making use of this new found knowledge in my studies in order to create websites that are effective in communicating information in a simple yet intuitive manner. <br> <br>

                <p>For the design of my website I wanted to create a unique mix of sleek minimalistic design with a touch of colourful cartoonish aesthetic. Here I aim to dissect the various elements that make up the UI and UX of my website and offer a comprehensive analysis of my design choices. Taking into consideration the established theories and principles in the field of UI and UX design covered so far this semester. When I began planning my website I looked to a few websites for inspiration, however one that caught my eye was the Kerbal Space Program site for its overall aesthetic that also fits seamlessly with the space theme of this assignment. <br> <br>

                    My colour palette for my website is curated with the intention of staying in line with the space theme whilst also maintaining the minimalistic aesthetic, featuring a deep black (#000000) as the background, contrasted by white (#FFF) text and accented by subtle touches of yellow (#f0bf55). I chose this colour scheme to reflect the cosmos with the black background representing the void of space with the white to represent the stars along with the subtle inclusion of yellow to add a touch of sci-fi aesthetic. I feel this worked well together however there are some areas of the site where the juxtapose of the black background contrasts against the pure white text making it less readable. For the text I used the "Orbitron" font for headers and titles and paragraph text. I chose this font as I found that it further reinforces the space-themed aesthetic. Wireframes were developed as a blueprint for the site at the start of its development to ensure a logical flow and structure that would guide the user's journey through the site in a seamless and user-friendly way.<br> <br>
                    
                    When designing the layout of my website with wireframes I took the Gestalt design principles explained by Kai Tomboc(2023) into consideration which advocate for visual hierarchy and balance. I did this with a focus on similarity, continuity, closure, common regions, symmetry and simplicity. These principles helped me create a cohesive layout for my website and I found them to be very useful when I was not sure where to place elements and how to structure them. Additionally I looked at Don Norman's (2013) seven principles of design found in Norman's Book "The Design of Everyday Things" with the aim to strike a balance between aesthetic appeal and functional usability.<br> <br>
                    
                    My website’s design strengths lie in its user-centric approach and minimalistic style in order to make the site more comprehensive. However, the minimalistic approach, while sleek and modern, could potentially be perceived as too sparse or lacking informational cues for some users. These strengths and weaknesses are considered in theories like Fitts' Law, which stresses the importance of making interactive elements easily accessible to users. However Hick's Law was taken into consideration as it warns against overwhelming users with too many choices. Another weakness could be found in the "Orbitron" font as at times it can prove difficult to read especially when it comes to the paragraph elements. This could be avoided in my next iteration by either finding a new font that fits with the theme of my website or to keep the "Orbitron" font for titles and headers whilst using a more readable font for paragraph elements.<br> <br>
                    
                    The inclusion of cartoon images of astronauts goes beyond mere aesthetics but aims to tell a story and evoke emotions. The astronaut on the homepage with the cosmic backdrop serve as narrative elements that contribute to a sense of exploration and discovery. This is supported by Norman's(2005) emotional design theory found in his essay "Emotional design: People and things", which asserts that design elements can evoke specific feelings and affect user engagement. Additionally the dynamic visuals, sourced from NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day," API adds another layer of engagement, offering users new content everyday that fits with the site's space theme.<br> <br>
                    
                    The layout of my site is predominantly asymmetrical for all pages except for the homepage where the elements are aligned to the centre of the screen. This layout was inspired by Kerbal Space Programs website where elements are placed asymmetrically below each other. I found this added a dynamic layer as the flow of information goes from left to right and back. The choice for the homepage to be aligned to the centre was made to make that page stand out and be more unique compared to the other pages as it serves as a launching pad to the other pages. I made use of white space between articles to indicate to the users where an article begins and ends as well as the use of white space and visual hierarchy further contributes to an uncluttered, user-friendly experience with the aim to enable easy navigation throughout the site, allowing users to easily find what they're looking for. <br> <br>
                    
                    My intention in the UI and UX design of the website was to create a harmonious blend of contrasting aesthetics, underpinned by researched theories and principles. While my design has its strengths in user-centric typography and aesthetic visuals, there is still much room for improvement. Despite this I am satisfied with the overall aesthetic of the site and I feel it is a good fit into the space theme for this assignment. I believe this is a great improvement from my website last semester which I felt lacked personality and its colour scheme was too bland.<br> <br>

                <p>I found Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin’s article “What is Interaction for Data Visualization?” to be very insightful as it delves into the indepth and often ambiguous realm of interaction within data visualisation. Dimara and Perin (2020) argue that the surrounding ambiguity of the term interaction comes from a lack of consensual definition and so they construct a comprehensive definition through the use of insights from the visualisation community and the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). <br> <br>

                    Dimara and Perin (2020) highlight that while interaction is fundamental to data visualisation, its meaning remains elusive: "We argue that a strong barrier to achieving this vision is not only that of the technical challenges, but like in HCI, that of defining interaction for visualisation" (Dimara and Perin, 2020). This ambiguity is not unique to the field of visualisation as even the broader field of HCI has struggled with defining "interaction" as its multifaceted nature is what makes defining it so challenging, this includes both the physical actions users take and the cognitive processes that accompany these actions.<br> <br>
                    
                    Dimara and Perin (2020) approach the understanding of interaction by first capturing the current view of interaction from the visualisation community "To address this problem, we first capture the current view of interaction from the visualisation community based on the input of researchers" (Dimara and Perin, 2020). Their findings show that interaction involves both external and internal entities and actions. Externally, it's a dialogue between the user and the visualisation system, characterised by action-reaction pairs, while internally it involves the cognitive processes of the user as they engage with the data.<br> <br>
                    
                    Dimara and Perin (2020) juxtapose the visualisation community's perspective with that of HCI, stating, "Interaction for visualisation is the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived as such" (Dimara and Perin, 2020). While HCI has its own set of definitions and concepts surrounding interaction, the authors seek commonalities and differences to craft a definition that is tailored to visualisation. From my perspective as a student majoring in interactive media and specialising in the creation of websites and web design this article has given me valuable insight in my field of study. Web design is an inherently interactive field where the principles of interaction in data visualisation can be applied.<br> <br>
                    
                    When I under go the process of creating a website, it is important to keep the user’s interaction with the site as a central focus as just as in data visualisation where the user's cognitive process and the system's responses are linked, in web design the user’s experience and the responsiveness of the website are related.  I found Dimara and Perin’s (2020) emphasis on the multifaceted nature of interaction to be particularly interesting as websites are not just about their aesthetics or functionality but about creating an experience for the user. Inorder to do this I need to consider the user’s intent, their cognitive process and how the websites design allows for easy and meaningful interaction. With rapid technological evolution comes a change in user behaviours and so my understanding of interaction must grow.<br> <br>
                    
                    In order for me to create a truly interactive website I need to anticipate the user’s needs and offer intuitive methods to guide their journey spent browsing my website and offer feedback mechanisms to allow for two-way communication between the user and the website. When designing a website I need to ask myself Will they be able to easily navigate through the site? Will the interactive elements enhance their experience or hinder it? In web design, the principles highlighted by Dimara and Perin (2020) about the importance of understanding and defining interaction can be a game-changer. I also found the article's focus on the internal and external facets of interaction to be important as it is a reminder that web design is not just about what's visible on the screen but is also about the underlying processes, algorithms, and systems that power these interactions.<br> <br>
                    
                    I believe that Dimara and Perin’s (2020) "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?" is a thought-provoking exploration of a term that many of us might have taken for granted. Dimara and Perin (2020) has challenged me to think deeper about what interaction truly means and how it shapes data visualisation  and user experience. As the field of data visualisation continues to evolve, having a clear and comprehensive understanding of interaction will be crucial for creating systems that can empower users. And as I continue my journey in interactive media, these insights will undoubtedly influence my approach to creating meaningful and impactful web experiences.<br> <br>

                <p>My objective for my data driven artwork was to make a representation of the sun and its Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) activity in a visually intriguing and informative way. My artwork sources its data from NASA’s DONKI CME API with the central circle symbolising the sin and the 90 lines which radiate out from the sun represent the CMEs over a period of 90 days. I had initially wanted to do 360 to more or less cover a year but the data would take a long time to load and so I decided to go with 90 instead. I aimed to create a dynamic and evolving representation that not only shows the sun's activity but also offers an interactive experience for the viewer allowing them to stop the rotation and observe individual CMEs and their information. This artwork is intended to provide a clear visual correlation between the sun's activity and the speed of the CMEs. <br> <br>

                    The artwork engages with the data set by filtering through the raw data provided by NASA’s API and transforming it into a visual representation. The ability for the user to stop the rotation of lines with their mouse and interact with individual lines allows for the viewer to gain a deeper look into the specific data points offering a dynamic experience. When the viewer hovers their mouse over a line a tooltip feature appears offering detailed information about each CME which assists in closing the gap between abstract representation of the data and the data itself. <br> <br>
                    
                    The artwork presents the data in a visually compelling format enhancing the meaning of the data as viewers can make clear distinctions between high speed CMEs which radiate out far away from the sun and slower CMEs which only make it so far from the sun. The close proximity of the lines creates an optical illusion whereby the lines appear to be warped, especially near the centre of the circle where the lines are closer to each other. This produces an almost psychedelic effect when coupled with the rotation of the lines that brings about a sense of the sun’s immense energy and power radiating from it enhancing the meaning for the artwork.<br> <br>
                    
                    However, my artwork also aims to subvert traditional representations of data as seen on my data visualisation page. Traditionally data is represented through static graphs or charts but instead my artwork represents the data through a dynamic, evolving and an interactive approach inviting viewers to engage with the data on a deeper level. Another effect prevalent in my artwork which was originally unintended is a subtle magnetosphere-like effect which can be seen when scrolling as a result of the lines proximity and movements, adding another layer of visual interest.<br> <br>
                                       
                    When I began working on my data driven artwork the ideas presented by Riche (2018) and  Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) assisted me in shaping my design process. Riche (2018) stresses the role of storytelling in data visualisation and believes that a story through data helps to engage the audience better. My attempt at doing so is found in how my artwork shows the sun's activity over the last 90 days allowing viewers to explore the sun's story through my artwork's interactive features.                   <br> <br>
                    
                    In the process of creating my artwork I kept Viégas and Wattenberg’s (2007) perspective in mind as they argue for a blend of aesthetics and functionality in data visualisation as this allows for the data to be more accessible and engaging. My artwork attempts to reflect this by offering a visually appealing representation of the data as the lines appear like sun rays radiating out from the sun similar to how CMEs are ejected from the sun. This is all done whilst keeping the data’s integrity intact as the length of the lines determined by the speed  of the CMEs and through the interactive features like the tooltip allow for the user to engage with the intact data.<br> <br>
                    
                    Also the unexpected and subtle magnetosphere-like effect in my artwork adds a layer of visual interest, aligning with Viégas and Wattenberg's (2007) idea of discovering unexpected insights through artistic data visualisation. This effect shows how an artistic approach can lead to new ways of seeing and understanding data. However, the magnetosphere-like effect has no correlation with the data as it is only a byproduct of the lines' close proximity. My design process was deeply influenced by the idea of blending storytelling, aesthetics, and functionality in data visualisation as discussed by Riche et al. (2018) and Viégas and Wattenberg (2007). <br> <br>
                    
                    In terms of my successes I believe the dynamic representation offers a unique visual experience, making the data more accessible and engaging, the tooltip feature bridges the gap between abstract representation and detailed data while the optical illusions which are present add layers of visual intrigue, enhancing viewer engagement. In terms of my failures I believe that the close proximity of the lines, especially near the centre, might make it challenging for some viewers to differentiate between individual data points while the unintentional yet interesting magnetosphere effect, being subtle and contingent on specific scrolling speeds, might be missed by many viewers.<br> <br>
                    
                    Reflecting upon my data-driven artwork, I recognize its strengths in offering a captivating visual narrative of the sun's activity. Drawing inspiration from the theoretical works covered in class, the artwork strikes a balance between aesthetic appeal and data integrity. While there are areas of improvement that I can always make as I believe art is never “complete”, the overall design successfully engages viewers and encourages them to think differently about data visualisation.<br> <br>

                <p>In digital arts and media, data visualisation and data art have emerged as central fields which combine the analytical power of data interpretation with artistic expression. While Data visualisation is rooted in objective analysis of information, data art introduces a subjective and emotive dimension. This intertwining of objective analysis and artistic expression shows an evolution in how we perceive and portray data. <br> <br>
                    The beginnings of Data Visualization can be traced back to its roots in scientific and academic disciplines as a tool for data exploration and hypothesis formation, it has been essential in simplifying complex information into comprehensible visual formats. The works of pioneers like William Playfair and Richard Feynman stand testament to its historical significance in scientific reasoning (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007). However, the introduction of advanced computer graphics and the democratisation of data sources have significantly expanded its scope. At the same time the emergence of Data Art marks a shift where artists began appropriating data visualisation techniques not just for analytical clarity but for artistic expression representing a melding of quantitative accuracy with creative narrative, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of data. Artistic visualisation, as noted by Viégas and Wattenberg (2007), is not merely an aesthetic rendition of data but a deliberate artistic endeavour grounded in factual information. <br> <br>
                    The conceptualization of representation explored by Kidd (2015), provides a good understanding of how these mediums function within the broader spectrum of media and culture. Building upon this with Hall’s theory as referenced by Kidd (2015), the integration of semiotics and a constructivist approach offers a lens through which the complexities of Data Visualization and Art can be critically examined.Representation, as posited by Kidd (2015), is not merely a reflection or a straightforward window onto the world but is a constructive process. This notion is crucial in understanding both Data Visualization and Data Art as in Data Visualization, representation is often viewed as a tool to convey factual and objective information. However, the process of selecting what data to present and how to present it is inherently a subjective one, influenced by the creator’s perspective, cultural context, and intended message. This process shapes the way in which the data is perceived and understood which underlines the constructivist nature of representation. <br> <br>
                    In the realm of Data Art, this constructivist approach takes on a more evident form as artists engage with data not only to represent reality but to question and interpret it, constructing new meanings and narratives. The artist's unique artistic style and thematic focus transforms raw data into a form of artistic and cultural expression. This reinforces the idea that representation is an active process of meaning-making, where the data turns into a canvas for artistic exploration. The role of semiotics in this process is equally significant as Kidd (2015) notes, semiotics, based on the foundational ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce, provides a framework for understanding how language and signs shape our perceptions. In the context of Data Visualization and Art, the semiotic analysis extends to the visual language used to represent data. The choice of colors, shapes, and layout in a data visualization are not mere aesthetic choices; they are laden with meanings and connotations that influence how the viewer interprets the data. Similarly, in Data Art, these visual elements are often employed deliberately to evoke certain emotions or to challenge conventional interpretations of data. This intersection of semiotics and constructivism in Data Visualization and Art highlights the dynamic nature of data representation. It is a process that involves the accurate depiction of information while considering the subjective interpretation and presentation of that information. The representations created are not static or universal but they are fluid, relying on the perspectives of both the creator and the viewer. <br> <br>
                    Data Visualization traditionally functions as a cornerstone in the realm of scientific inquiry and analytics. Its primary objective is to transform complex data sets into visual formats that facilitate understanding and analysis. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) illustrate this approach by referencing examples such as William Playfair's economic charts and Richard Feynman’s diagrams in quantum field theory, which shows the role of data visualization in making intricate concepts accessible and analyzable. Data visualization has been indispensable for exploring hypotheses, discerning patterns, and communicating findings effectively. It strips away the excess, focusing on presenting data in a manner that is immediately comprehensible and analytically useful with the goal to provide a clear, unbiased view of the data which allows the viewer to draw conclusions based on factual evidence. The integrity of scientific analysis relies on the ability to perceive and interpret data without distortion or subjective influence. The emphasis on dispassionate analysis in traditional data visualisation does not diminish its creative aspects. The design choices made in these visualisations from colour schemes to graphical representations are critical in conveying information accurately and efficiently. However, these choices are guided by principles of clarity and utility rather than artistic expression resulting in visualisations that are tools designed for insight rather than intrigue, prioritising functionality over form. <br> <br>
                    In contrast to the objectivity of traditional data visualisation, Data Art emerges as a medium where data serves not just as a source of information, but as a vehicle for artistic expression. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) highlight that Data Art is characterised by the intent of making art, where artists leverage data as a medium to convey messages, evoke emotions, and provoke thought. Unlike data visualisation, Data Art embraces complexity and subjectivity inviting viewers to engage with data on a more personal and emotional level. Data Art operates at the intersection of information and interpretation, infusing data with aesthetic and conceptual dimensions as artists in this field use data to tell stories, challenge perceptions, and explore societal themes. This form of artistic practice is demonstrated in the works of Jason Salavon who uses aggregated data from everyday sources like yearbooks and real estate listings to create visual narratives that reflect on collective human experiences transforming raw data into a medium for exploring broader cultural and social questions. The representation of data in data art extends its potential to resonate with viewers on a deeper level as this approach to data representation is less about extracting clear-cut answers and more about provoking questions and reflections.  <br> <br>
                    The strategies of representation in Data Art and Visualization highlight their divergent yet complementary roles in interpreting and presenting data. Data Visualization is primarily focused on elucidating information, where visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps are employed to extract complex data into comprehensible visual narratives. This process is rooted in the principles of clarity and precision, and aims to facilitate objective analysis and decision-making. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) highlight the importance of such analytical tools in providing a clear view of data which is essential in scientific and economic contexts. In contrast, Data Art adopts a strategy that leverages visual elements to invoke reflection, emotion, and dialogue transcending the traditional boundaries of data representation by infusing artistic creativity and subjective interpretation into the visualization process. As Roeser (2016) argues, techno-art, an intersection of technology and art, enriches public deliberation and decision-making by introducing new perspectives and challenging existing ones. Data Art not only represents data but also reinterprets and recontextualizes it, encouraging viewers to engage with data on a more profound and personal level. <br> <br>
                    The exploration of Data Visualization and Data Art also necessitates a discussion on ethical considerations and impact as the power to represent data brings with it the responsibility to do so accurately and fairly. In Data Visualization, ethical considerations revolve around the accuracy of representation and the avoidance of misleading or biased interpretations and so the integrity of the visualization process is very important as any misrepresentations of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and misinformed decisions. Data Art, while embracing subjectivity, also faces ethical challenges as artistic manipulation of data must balance between creative expression and the truthful representation of information. Artists must recognise the implications that their work might have on public perception and understanding as Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) note, artistic visualisations can be powerful in shaping opinions and attitudes making it crucial for artists to consider the potential impact of their work. Both Data Visualization and Data Art have significant societal impacts as they shape how we understand and interact with data, influencing everything from public policy to cultural discourse. Through presenting data in various forms, they have the power to illuminate truths, uncover hidden patterns, and even challenge societal norms and so people in these fields must be mindful of their role in shaping public understanding and discourse. <br> <br>
                    The study of Data Visualization and Data Art reveals various methods and styles in presenting data as Data Visualization aims for objective clarity and accuracy, while Data Art values subjectivity and emotive impact. These approaches have different goals and techniques, however they share the common purpose of transforming data into insightful stories providing distinct yet complementary views on data representation, each adding to our comprehension and appreciation of information. The ethical implications and societal effects of these practices highlight their important role in influencing our perception of reality as we advance in a data-centric society, the merging of Data Visualization and Data Art becomes increasingly vital in improving our ability to process and interact with the available information. Their combined use is not only a technique for representing data but also a means to better understand the complexities of today's world. <br> <br>
