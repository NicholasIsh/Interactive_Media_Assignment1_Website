            <h2>Helios</h2>
            <p>Delve into a dynamic representation of the sun and its Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) activity over a 90-day period, sourced directly from NASA's DONKI CME API. This artwork encapsulates a central circle symbolizing the sun, from which 90 radiant lines emanate—each representing a CME event. As the lines rotate, experience the sun’s immense energy, intensified by a mesmerizing optical illusion created by the lines' proximity. Hover to pause this celestial dance and reveal tooltips detailing individual CMEs, bridging the abstract with factual data.
                The artwork is not just a visual treat but an interactive one, inviting viewers to engage deeply with the data. Witness the sun's activity story, where longer lines denote high-speed CMEs radiating further out, while shorter ones depict slower CMEs. Subtly, an unintended magnetosphere-like effect emerges, a testament to the wonders of artistic data visualization.
                Embracing the principles of storytelling, aesthetics, and functionality, this piece reimagines traditional data representation. It is a blend of aesthetic allure and data integrity, all while offering unexpected insights and promoting viewer engagement. Dive in, explore, and experience the sun's power and mystery like never before.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Echoes (Exam)</h2>
            <p>This digital artwork, titled "Orbital Echoes," uses data from NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API to create a visual representation of the trajectories of the last 90 near-earth objects (NEOs) that passed by Earth. At the center of this piece is a circle symbolizing Earth, around which 90 parabolic lines are rendered to illustrate the paths of these NEOs.

                The trajectories in this artwork are not only visual elements but also data-driven representations. Each line's curvature is calculated based on the NEO's velocity and miss distance from Earth. NEOs with higher velocities have lines with less curvature, indicating their swift movement, while those with larger miss distances display increased curvature, suggesting a safer passage by Earth.
                
                The color coding of the lines adds another layer of information. NEOs closer to Earth are marked with red, indicating proximity, while those further away are shown in green, signaling distance and safety. This color gradient offers an immediate visual cue about the relative position of each NEO.
                
                An interactive feature of this artwork is the tooltip function. When viewers hover over a line, they can access more detailed information about the NEO it represents, such as its size, composition, and the date it passed nearest to Earth. This feature makes the artwork not just a visual piece but also an informative tool for understanding the dynamics of NEOs in relation to our planet.
                
                "Near-Earth Trajectories Visualization" is a blend of art and science, aiming to present complex astronomical data in an accessible and visually engaging format. It invites viewers to appreciate the intricacies of space and the ongoing movement of objects within it.</p>
