            <section class="feature">
                
                <p>The visual aesthetic of my website is a harmonious fusion of sleek minimalist design and a light hearted cartoonish element. This blend results in a design that captures users attention through the cartoon images as well as providing an uncluttered and easily navigable website. The colour palette plays a pivotal role in achieving this aesthetic as the deep space blacks juxtaposed with white and a slight touch of yellow creates an overall visually aesthetic experience.

                <p>At the heart of the design are visuals that centred around the theme of space exploration in a cartoon style take. The homepage features a charming cartoon astronaut standing atop a yellow moon, planting a flag and extending a hand in a gesture. This whimsical portrayal represents the human desire for exploration and discovery. The astronaut's presence acts as a symbol of our innate curiosity, inviting users to explore my site and what it has to offer. The juxtaposition of the astronaut against the backdrop of space serves as a visual metaphor for the fusion of human ambition with the mysteries of space.

                <p>The typography chosen for the website plays a pivotal role in reinforcing the sleek minimalist and space-themed design. "Orbitron" is selected as the font for headers and titles. Its sleek and modern appearance alludes to space-age technology and advancement, encapsulating the spirit of exploration. The careful spacing and sizing of fonts ensure a seamless reading experience allowing users to absorb the content.

                <p>The website's layout is thoughtfully structured to mirror the journey of cosmic exploration. The homepage has a welcome section, serving as a captivating entry point. Here, users are greeted by a statement that piques their curiosity. The introduction is enhanced by an animated orange "Explore" button that beckons users to initiate their voyage into my website. Additionally, the integration of NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day" presents users with daily images of celestial marvels and insights into them. Each blog post is meticulously framed against a cosmic backdrop, ensuring alignment with the overarching theme with each section being offset from the last with the same applying for the design page.

Varying font sizes and boldness guide users' attention to pivotal content, allowing them to navigate with ease. The equilibrium is masterfully orchestrated, with elements thoughtfully distributed to create a symphony of visuals. The utilisation of white space contributes to a sense of balance, ensuring that the design remains uncluttered and user-friendly.

By harnessing minimalistic aesthetics and cosmic wonder, the design invites users to delve into the mysteries of space. The navigation bar at the top of the page is slightly transparent to add an additional layer of aesthetic and sleekness to the design of the pages.

                    #fff - Primary colour for text throughout the website. <br>
                    #f0bf55 - this yellow colour is used lightly across the site and can be seen in buttons and 'p' element dividers, bringing colour to the otherwise black and white website in a sleek and minimalist fashion. <br> <br>
