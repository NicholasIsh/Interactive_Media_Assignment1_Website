            <h1>Data Visualisation</h1>
            <p>On this page, you'll find two graphs created using data from NASA's NeoWs and DONKI APIs. These graphs provide a clear representation of complex space-related data. The visualizations aim to make the data more accessible and easier to understand. Explore the graphs to gather insights and understand the patterns derived from the data. Dive in to get a clearer picture of the data's significance.</p>

                <h2>Near Earth Objects</h2>
                <p>This bubble chart provides an illustrative representation of the size and proximity of near-Earth objects (NEOs) observed over a week, using data sourced from NASA's DONKI API. The X-axis signifies the miss distance of each NEO from Earth, measured in kilometers, while the Y-axis indicates their relative velocity in kilometers per second. The size of each bubble corresponds to the estimated diameter of the NEO. Larger bubbles represent bigger NEOs, emphasizing their significance. This chart offers an immediate visual insight into the relative sizes, speeds, and distances of the NEOs.</p>

                <h2>Solar Flare Activity</h2>
                <p>This graph represents the solar flare activity recorded over the past 12 days, using data sourced from NASA's DONKI API. The x-axis represents the date, displaying each day the data was collected on. Meanwhile, the y-axis indicates the time of day when each flare event began, measured in hours. By observing the plotted data points and the connecting line, one can discern patterns or trends in solar flare activity, such as specific days or times when the activity was particularly high or low.</p>

                <h2>Coronal Mass Ejection</h2>
                <p>This interactive line chart visualizes the speed of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) observed over a selectable duration, with data sourced from NASA's DONKI API. The X-axis represents the start date of each CME event, while the Y-axis showcases their speed in kilometers per second. By using the slider below the chart, users can dynamically adjust the time frame displayed, ranging from a week to a month. This feature allows for a tailored exploration of CME activity over different periods. The chart provides a comprehensive view of the fluctuations in CME speeds, emphasizing the variability and intensity of solar activity. Engage with the slider to delve deeper into specific time frames and gain insights into the sun's dynamic behavior.</p>
